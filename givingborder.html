      <p>
        HTML paragraph or HTML p tag is used to define a paragraph in a webpage.
        Let's take a simple example to see how it work. It is a notable point
        that a browser itself add an empty line before and after a paragraph. An
        HTML tag indicates starting of new paragraph.

        example, to alter the font, color, size, and spacing of your content,
        split it into multiple columns, or add animations and other decorative
        features. This module provides a gentle beginning to your path towards
        CSS mastery with the basics of how it works, what the syntax looks like,
        and how you can start using it to add styling to HTML
