        HTML paragraph or HTML p tag is used to define a paragraph in a webpage.
        Let's take a simple example to see how it work. It is a notable point

        HTML tag indicates starting of new paragraph.

        features. This module provides a gentle beginning to your path towards
        CSS mastery with the basics of how it works, what the syntax looks like,
